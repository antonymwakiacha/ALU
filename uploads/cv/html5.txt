	<input type="text" name="username">
	<input type="password" name="password" autocomplete="off"> 
   </form>

	<input type="text" nme="query" autofocus="autofocus">

THE REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE
Ensures that a field has been completed before a form is submitted.Use it like this:

	<input type="text" name="creditcard" required="required">

OVERRIDE ATTRIBUTES 
Here you can override form settings on an element-by-element basis.
E.g
	<form action="url1.php" method="post">
	    <input type="text" name="field">
	    <input type="submit" formaction="url2.php">

The 2nd form action overrides the first and submits the form to a different url other than the one specified in the first url.

   <input type="range" name="num" min="0" value="50" step="1">

DATE AND TIME PICKERS
When you choose an input type of date,month,week,time,datetime or datetime-local,a picker will pop on supported browsers from which the user can make a selection like this one,which inputs the time:
